# FAE Character Sheet (Fill + Print) — React Learning Project

A small React + Vite project I’m building to learn React while making a practical tool: **a fillable Fate Accelerated Edition (FAE) character sheet that can be printed**.

## What it does

- Lets you **input character data** (name, aspects, approaches, stunts, stress, consequences, etc.)
- Shows a **live preview** of what will be printed
- Provides a **print-friendly character sheet** (background image + positioned fields) via the browser print dialog

## Tech

- React
- Vite
- Plain CSS (including `@media print` for print layout)

## Getting started
